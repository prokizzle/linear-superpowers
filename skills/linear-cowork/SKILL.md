# Linear Cowork

Standardized Linear collaboration workflow for vibe coding teams.

## MCP Setup

Before using this skill, ensure the Linear MCP server is installed and authenticated. See `skills/linear-cowork/setup-guide.md` for detailed instructions.

## Issue Conventions

### Naming Rule

All issue titles MUST follow this format:

```
[Type] Short description
```

Valid types:

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `[Feature]` | New functionality |
| `[Bug]` | Bug fix |
| `[Chore]` | Maintenance, dependencies, config |
| `[Refactor]` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `[Docs]` | Documentation changes |

Examples:
- `[Feature] Add OAuth login flow`
- `[Bug] Fix crash on empty cart submission`
- `[Chore] Upgrade React to v19`

Bad examples (DO NOT use):
- `add login` — missing type prefix
- `[Feature] Login` — too vague, not descriptive
- `Feature: add login` — wrong format, must use brackets

### Description Template

Every issue description MUST include these two sections:

```markdown
## Background
[Why this issue exists. What problem it solves. Any relevant context.]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific, testable criterion]
- [ ] [Another criterion]
```

Do not skip Acceptance Criteria. Even for small tasks, at least one criterion is required.

## Workflow Rules

### Default Assignment

When creating an issue via the Linear MCP, always assign it to "me" (the current authenticated user) unless the user explicitly specifies a different assignee.

### Issue Status Lifecycle

Linear issues have 6 statuses. Proactively update issue status as the user's work progresses:

| Status | Type | When to use |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Backlog | backlog | Unplanned — collected but not yet confirmed |
| Todo | unstarted | Confirmed and ready to be worked on |
| In Progress | started | Actively being worked on |
| Done | completed | Work finished and verified |
| Canceled | canceled | Will not be done |
| Duplicate | canceled | Already covered by another issue |

Status transition rules:

```
Backlog → Todo → In Progress → Done
                              → Canceled
                              → Duplicate
```

- **Creating an issue:** Set to **Todo** (not Backlog) unless user specifies otherwise
- **User starts working on an issue:** Update to **In Progress**
- **Committing code for an issue:** Update to **Done**
- **User says to cancel/skip:** Update to **Canceled**
- **User identifies a duplicate:** Update to **Duplicate**

**Proactive status updates:** When context makes it obvious (e.g., user says "I'm working on ONE-42" or "let's start ONE-42"), update the status to **In Progress** without needing to be asked. Similarly, when committing code linked to an issue, update to **Done** automatically.

### Labels

Every issue MUST have a label. Choose based on the issue type:

| Label | Color | When to use |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Feature | purple | New functionality (`[Feature]` issues) |
| Bug | red | Bug fixes (`[Bug]` issues) |
| Improvement | blue | Enhancements, refactors, chores, docs (`[Refactor]`, `[Chore]`, `[Docs]` issues) |

Mapping from issue type to label:

| Issue Type | Label |
|------------|-------|
| `[Feature]` | Feature |
| `[Bug]` | Bug |
| `[Chore]` | Improvement |
| `[Refactor]` | Improvement |
| `[Docs]` | Improvement |

Apply the label automatically when creating an issue — do not ask the user unless the mapping is ambiguous.

### Priority

Every issue MUST have a priority set. Default to **Medium (3)** unless the user specifies otherwise.

| Value | Level | When to use |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | No priority | Never use as default |
| 1 | Urgent | Production down, data loss, security vulnerability |
| 2 | High | Blocks other work, major user-facing issue |
| 3 | Medium | Default — standard feature work, normal bugs |
| 4 | Low | Nice-to-have, minor polish, tech debt |

## Subagent Strategy

Use different models for different tasks to balance cost and quality:

| Task | Model | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| Read from Linear (list issues, get details) | Haiku subagent | Cheap, fast, repetitive |
| Write to Linear (create/update issues, comments) | Haiku subagent | Simple API calls |
| Explore codebase for issue context | Explore subagent | Efficient file search |
| Draft issue content (title, description, criteria) | Main model | Requires quality writing |

### Issue Creation Workflow

1. **Haiku** → Read Linear (check existing issues, projects, team context)
2. **Explore** → Search codebase if needed (understand context for the issue)
3. **Main** → Draft issue title, description, and acceptance criteria
4. **Preview** → Show draft to user for confirmation
5. **Haiku** → Submit to Linear after user approves

### Issue Update Workflow

1. **Haiku** → Read current issue state from Linear
2. **Main** → Determine changes needed (may explore codebase if needed)
3. **Preview** → Show changes to user for confirmation (if content changes)
4. **Haiku** → Apply updates to Linear

### Key Rules

- **Always preview issue content before submission.** Show the user the full title, description, labels, priority, and status before creating or making content changes.
- **Status-only updates** (e.g., Todo → In Progress) do NOT need preview — apply directly.
- Simple reads and writes go through Haiku to save context tokens.
- Content that users will see (titles, descriptions, criteria) must be drafted by the main model for quality.

## Project Organization

- Use Linear Projects to group related issues by feature area or milestone
- Before creating issues, check if a relevant project exists
- If no project exists and the work spans 3+ issues, create a project first

## Pre-commit Checklist

Before every commit, follow this flow:

```
About to commit?
  ├─ Related to Linear issue?
  │   ├─ Unknown → Ask user for issue ID
  │   │   ├─ User confirms → Update status to completed, include ID in commit
  │   │   └─ No issue → Proceed with commit
  │   ├─ Yes, known → Update status to completed, include ID in commit
  │   └─ No → Proceed with commit
```

Steps:

1. Before committing, ask: *"Is this commit related to a Linear issue? If so, which one (e.g., ONE-123)?"*
2. If user provides an issue ID:
   - Use a subagent to update the issue status to **Done**
   - Include the issue ID in the commit message, e.g.: `[ONE-123] Fix cart crash on empty submission`
3. If user says no issue is related, proceed with the commit normally.

### Commit Message Format with Issue ID

```
[ISSUE-ID] commit message

# Examples:
[ONE-42] Add OAuth login flow
[ONE-15] Fix crash on empty cart submission
```
